# Standalone AI Chatbot Integration Guide

## Overview
This is a standalone AI chatbot implementation that can be added to your existing project without modifying any existing files or functionality.

## Files Created
1. `app/chatbot_standalone.py` - Backend chatbot logic
2. `app/chatbot_urls.py` - URL configuration
3. `app/static/app/js/chatbot.js` - Frontend chatbot widget
4. This guide file

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add URL Pattern
Add this single line to your main `ec/urls.py` file:

```python
# In ec/urls.py, add this import at the top
from app.chatbot_urls import chatbot_urlpatterns

# In the urlpatterns list, add:
urlpatterns = [
    # ... your existing patterns ...
] + chatbot_urlpatterns  # Add this line at the end
```

### Step 2: Include JavaScript on Pages
Add this single line to any template where you want the chatbot:

```html
<!-- Add this before closing </body> tag -->
<script src="{% static 'app/js/chatbot.js' %}"></script>
```
