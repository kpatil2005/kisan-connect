# Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue
Your Render deployment is failing because it's using an old requirements.txt with heavy ML packages.

## Solution

### Step 1: Verify requirements.txt
Make sure your `requirements.txt` contains ONLY these packages:

```
asgiref==3.9.1
certifi==2025.8.3
charset-normalizer==3.4.1
cloudinary==1.42.0
dj-database-url==2.2.0
Django==5.2.6
django-cloudinary-storage==0.3.0
django-widget-tweaks==1.5.0
deep-translator==1.11.4
google-generativeai==0.8.4
gunicorn==23.0.0
idna==3.10
Pillow==11.1.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.10
python-dotenv==1.0.1
requests==2.32.3
sqlparse==0.5.3
urllib3==2.5.0
whitenoise==6.8.2
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes

Open terminal in the `ec` folder and run:

```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Fix: Update requirements.txt - remove ML packages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Trigger Render Deployment

After pushing, Render will automatically detect the changes and redeploy.

Or manually trigger deployment from Render dashboard:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" button
3. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"

## Expected Result

✅ Deployment should complete in 2-3 minutes (instead of timing out)
✅ Build size reduced from 2GB+ to ~200MB
✅ No more ML package installation errors

## If Still Failing

Check these:
1. Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch (main)
2. Verify Render is connected to the correct repository
3. Check that `build.sh` exists and is executable
4. Verify all environment variables are set in Render dashboard
